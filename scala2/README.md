# Scala Journey

### Best sources
* Quick syntax: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/scala/ - finished 6/28/2017
* [Essential Scala](http://underscore.io/training/courses/essential-scala/)

More detailed:
* [StackOverflow Scala wiki](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/scala/info)
* When in doubt, check the [Scala official API](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.2/)


### Notes
Scala changes very quickly.

* 2.12.0 released 03-Nov-2016
* 2.11.0 released 21-Apr-2014
* 2.10.0 released 04-Jan-2013
* Any older is too different. eg. dramatic changes in Array representation in Scala 2.8:

Type hierarchy:

### Specific
* Using "scalac -deprecation -feature" allows compiler to throw many helpful warnings & messages.

* Difference between 'val' and 'var': val is "final", var is not.
* Default type for an ambiguous "var" is "Any", which is the grand supertype of all Scala types.
If type ambiguous, Scala chooses their closest common ancestor.
* Why no "i++" in Scala - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4520463/why-no-i-in-scala
* Scalaâ€™s == operator is smart - it delegates to equals rather than comparing values on reference identity

* What are futures? Actor support? Lazy val? Type classes? Type Erasure?
* Most of the object-oriented design patterns which require loads of boilerplate code in Java are supported natively, e.g. Singleton (via objects), Adapter, Decorator (via traits and implicits), Visitor (via pattern matching), Strategy (via closures) etc.
