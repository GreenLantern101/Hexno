# Hodge-podge

A whole bunch of scattered utter randomness that may one day turn into diamonds, rubies, and other uselessly beautiful things. 

**Translation:** A repo to hold half-baked ideas that may turn into more developed projects.

Currently:
* **apikey-hunter** - searches for API keys on github
* **CSS Animations** - test out various CSS animations
* **Dictionary** - a simple concept test of replacing emojis in text with sample html tags. Works recursively (Java). TODO: make version using stack
* **Fixstep** - Node.js-based app to synchronize Youtube videos inside browsers (Javascript, html, css)
* **Hexno** - a hexgrid implementation with mouse handler (Java)
* **ml_exoplanets** - OpenExoplanetCatalogue data w/ scikit-learn ml library playground
